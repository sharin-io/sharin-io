## Hallo! 👋  

I'm Shin Thant Thi Ri, a programmer who loves problem-solving, organizing things and making life easier through code.  

Note: "**Sharin**" is what people call me 

<p>&nbsp;<img align="center" src="https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=sharin-io&show_icons=true&locale=en" alt="sharin-io" /></p>

**About Me**  
- 🐱 Proud cat parent—my cats may or may not walk over my keyboard mid-project.  
- 💻 I enjoy coding, automating tasks, and optimizing workflows.  
- 📚 Currently balancing university, programming, and side projects.  
- 🛠️ I love building things that save time (because why do something manually when you can automate it?).  

**Fun Facts**  
- 🎮 When I'm not coding, I'm either playing games or being interrupted by my cats.  
- ☕ Debugging is 90% of my job. Coffee helps with the other 10%.  
- 🍣 I have an *unhealthy* obsession with good food—seriously, I plan my days around meals.
